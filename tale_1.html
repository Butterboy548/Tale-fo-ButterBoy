        <p class="tale_1"> I was sweating and adrenaline was racing through me. I took one step towards the portal. Then another. In no time I was right before the End Portal and was ready to hop in. It was time for my leap of faith. I jumped and fell through the mysterious portal and found myself in a small room made out of a strange material. I checked everything over; armor: check, weapons: check, bow and arrows: check, Strength Potions: check. I was ready. I got out my pickaxe and started mining up. Pretty soon I saw the dark skies of the End World. As I looked around, my heart sank. There were tons of Endermen (tall black and purple humanoid monsters that have the ability to teleport) but there wasn't an exit portal. I was stuck in this barren wasteland unless I could kill the Ender Dragon. Suddenly a roar ripped through the air and the fearsome dragon dove straight for me! I hurriedly brought my bow out and nocked an arrow, however in my shaken state I missed and hit a glass box that was on top of one of the many tall obsidian towers. Right when my arrow hit the box of glass, it blew up. Before I could process that, however, I was hit by the Ender Dragon right on my chest. Thankfully my armor was loaded with protective enchantment because if it hadn't...... well I don't want to think about it. As the Ender Dragon flew away from me, I saw that he "connected" to one of the glass boxes on another obsidian tower via a zap of light. After the path of light disconnected, I was shocked to see that he had healed and regained health. The glass boxes healed him! i didn't know how they did it, but I knew I had to destroy the boxes with my arrows before the Ender Dragon came back and decided to finish me off. So my mission began. I destroyed tower after tower, for who knows how long. And all the while I was nervously looking over my shoulder, making sure the Ender Dragon wasn't coming back yet.</p>

        <p class="tale_2">After a while, I was onto the last glass box I had my arrow nocked and my aim was on the box. That's when I heard a roar behind me. Before I had time to even turn around, I was hit into the air by the Ender Dragon's powerful dive. I didn't remember firing my bow, but I guess I did because the next moment the glass box exploded wth a might <i>boom!</i>. That's when I started falling back down to the ground. When my feet hit the ground, I lost three hearts. I knew the Ender Dragon was coming back soon so I hurriedly got out my enchanted diamond sword and checked my arrows. I saw the Dragon's outline approaching to my left and I shoot a few barrages out of my enchanted bow. I hit the Ender Dragon a few times and he flew away from me. A couple minutes later, he came back and when he went down into a dive, I was able to hit him three times with my sword. The third time he came around, he was very low on helath and I nocked an arrow and fired...... but I missed! He came swooping down and hit me square in the chest. I lost over half my hearts but as the Ender Dragon was getting away, I was able to hit him once with my sword.... and that killed him! I got a ton of enchanting points along with the Ender Dragon Egg. Then a portal opened up and I was able to leave the End. I will never forget that intense fight!</p>
