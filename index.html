    <p>I was sweating and adrenaline was racing through me. I took one step towards the portal. Then another. In no time I was right before the End Portal, and was ready to hop in. It was time for my leap of faith. I jumped and fell through the mysterious portal and found myself in a small room made out of a strange material. I checked everything over; armor: check, weapons: check, bow and arrows: check, Strength Potions: check. I was ready. I got out my pickaxe and started mining up. Pretty soon I saw the dark skies of the End World. As I looked around, my heart sank. There were tons of Endermen (tall black and purple humanoid monsters that have the ability to teleport) but there wasn't an exit portal. I was stuck in this barren wasteland unless I could kill the Ender Dragon. Suddenly a roar ripped through the air and the fearsome dragon dove straight for me! I hurriedly brought my bow out and nocked an arrow, however in my shaken state I missed and hit a glass box that was on top of one of the many tall obsidian towers. Right when my arrow hit the box of glass, it blew up. Before I could process that, however, I was hit by the Ender Dragon right on my chest. Thankfully my armor was loaded with protective enchantment because if it hadn't...... well I don't want to think about it. As the Ender Dragon flew away from me, I saw that he "connected" to one of the glass boxes on another obsidian tower via a zap of light. After the path of light disconnected, I was shocked to see that he had healed and regained health. The glass boxes healed him! i didn't know how they did it, but I knew I had to destroy the boxes with my arrows before the Ender Dragon came back and decided to finish me off.</p>
