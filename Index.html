    <h3>THE TALE OF BUTTERBOY</h3>
    <h5>Article Written By Daniel Leung</h5>
    <p class=paragraph1>Our reporters have managed to get exclusive stories about the amazing hero who has completed feats of <i>unimaginable difficulty</i>. For instance, ButterBoy (the amazing hero of greatness) eradicated an entire town of villagers who had turned zombies. Another mind blowing accomplishment was when ButterBoy defeated the potent Wither Boss. However, I believe his biggest achievement was when he defeated the dragon of darkness, <b>The ENDER DRAGON!</b> Amazing! To read his first hand accounts of his adventures, look below!</p>

    <p>I was sweating and adrenaline was racing through me. I took one step towards the portal. Then another. In no time I was right before the End Portal, and was ready to hop in. It was time for my leap of faith. I jumped and fell through the mysterious portal and found myself in a small room made out of a strange material. I checked everything over; armor: check, weapons: check, bow and arrows: check</p>
