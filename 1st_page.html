    <h3>THE TALES OF BUTTERBOY</h3>
    <h5>Article Written By Daniel Leung</h5>
    <p class=paragraph1>Our reporters have managed to get exclusive stories about the amazing hero who has completed feats of <i>unimaginable difficulty</i>. For instance, ButterBoy (the amazing hero of greatness) eradicated an entire town of villagers who had turned zombies. Another mind blowing accomplishment was when ButterBoy defeated the potent Wither Boss. However, I believe his biggest achievement was when he defeated the dragon of darkness, <b>The ENDER DRAGON!</b> Amazing! To read his first hand accounts of his adventures, read the preview below or go straight to <a href="https://preview.c9.io/butterboy548/ctd-html-css/Cool_Tale/index.html?_c9_id=livepreview0&_c9_host=https://ide.c9.io" target="_blank">pages 2-4!</a></p>

    <p>I was sweating and adrenaline was racing through me. I took one step towards the portal. Then another. In no time I was right before the End Portal, and was ready to hop in. It was time for my leap of faith. I jumped and fell through the mysterious portal and found myself in a small room made out of a strange material. I checked everything over; armor: check, weapons: check, bow and arrows: check, Strength Potions: check. I was ready. I got out my pickaxe and started mining up. Pretty soon I saw the dark skies of the End World. As I looked around, my heart sank. There were tons of <dfn>Endermen</dfn>(tall black and purple humanoid monsters that have the ability to teleport) but there wasn't an exit portal. I was stuck in this barren wasteland unless I could kill the Ender Dragon. Suddenly a roar ripped through the air and the fearsome dragon dove straight for me! <i><a href="https://preview.c9.io/butterboy548/ctd-html-css/Cool_Tale/index.html?_c9_id=livepreview0&_c9_host=https://ide.c9.io" target="_blank">Continued on page 2...</a></i> </p>
